# Temperature-Sensing-and-Displaying-Acquired-Data-over-Wi-Fi-using-IoT
The objective of this project is to demonstrate UDP communication between two Tiva C Series micro-controllers. Along with Tiva Boards , the system consists of Educational Booster MKII and two CC3100 Wi-Fi Booster-Packs. An external LM35 temperature sensor is used to sense the temperature of the environment. The sensed temperature is converted from analog to digital at one CC3100 connected Tiva Board and then packed as UDP packets and sent over the Wi-Fi to another CC3100 connected Tiva board. The server controller unpacks the UDP messages and display it on the LCD display of the Booster- Pack MKII.
